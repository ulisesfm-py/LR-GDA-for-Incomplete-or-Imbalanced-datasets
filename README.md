# LR GDA for Incomplete or Imbalanced datasets
This project implements Logistic Regression and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) classifiers and explores techniques for handling incomplete, positive-only labels and imbalanced datasets.

The notebook includes:

* Implementation of Logistic Regression using Newton's Method
* Implementation of Gaussian Discriminant Analysis from scratch
* Visualization of decision boundaries on datasets
* Techniques for training classifiers with incomplete labels
* Approaches to learning from imbalanced datasets

## Features
* Builds classifiers without relying on external machine learning libraries
* Demonstrates the impact of incomplete and imbalanced data on model performance
* Provides visualizations to aid in understanding classifier behavior

## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
